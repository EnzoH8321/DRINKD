# DRINKD
App that lets you and your friend's plan for a night out. 

## Why?
The hardest part about going for a night out with your friends is deciding where to go. Everyone has their own opinions, no one can decide on anything. With this app, you create a party, invite your friends and vote on which bar or restaurant you would like to go to. Highest vote wins. No arguing or complaining. 

## Getting Started
